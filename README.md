# Online-Presence-Remover
The Online Presence Remover is a program that uses python to enable users to completely remove their online presence from a variety of websites. Nowdays, people have numerous accounts on all sorts of websites, and keeping track of them can be difficult. However it's almost a guarantee that they're tracking you. 

In order to increase users privacy online, this tool will take a users email address and run it across a database to see where accounts have been created with the same email. We will then ask the user which accounts they'd like removed, and proceed to delete their information from all sites they selected.
